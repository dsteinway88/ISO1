					<li>Be aware of your physical surroundings, and those around you, when entering passwords or PINs.
					<li>Never leave devices unattended in public places.

	<h1>Outside the Office</h1>
	<p>The ability to access Firm resources and data from any location, 24/7 has become increasingly important to meeting our clients’ needs. When accessing the Firm network from outside the office, it’s important to understand the possible risks of using unsecured devices, Wi-Fi, and some of the key considerations to keep in mind related to travel security.</p>
	<p>Although free Wi-Fi is convenient, most free public Wi-Fi points, such as those in coffee shops and airports, are not secured by password and offer no encryption. Data sent and received via an unsecured, unencrypted Wi-Fi connection can easily be captured by another user on the same network with only the most basic of interception tools, many of which are widely available.</p>
	<p>In recent years, reports of hacking and cyber attacks targeting international travels have dramatically increased. In light of this, it’s important to be vigilant about protecting your devices and information while traveling abroad. If using Wi-Fi outside the country, be sure to connect to an encrypted service before transferring sensitive information. And keep in mind, too, that in some countries, data is routinely monitored and collected by government agencies, and you might even be asked by a government official to provide your credentials so your laptop or mobile device can be unlocked and examined.</p>

	<h1>International Travel</h1>
	<p>Before you pack your suitcase for a trip abroad, you should take some time to consider how you are going to secure your data devices: laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Recent reports indicate that the focus of international hacker groups is not just your credit card or ATM numbers, but intellectual capital and information. </p>
	<p>When planning your trip, contact your IT Department or Security Manager for information on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The risks of wireless access, “shoulder surfing,” and “juice jacking.”
		<li>Limit the number of media devices that you carry
		<li>Remove unnecessary information on your devices
		<li>Be aware of your surroundings and your business conversations
		<li>Run anti-virus and security updates before and after traveling
	</ul>
	<p>Good security habits protect not only our Firm, but also our clients. Travel safe.</p>
