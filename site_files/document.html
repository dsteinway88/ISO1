		<h1>Confidential vs. Protected</h1>
		<p>Confidential information is a broad term which, although it does imply some level of sensitivity and should be appropriately secured, it is not the term we will use to identify information which is specifically addressed by law or regulation.</p>
		<P>Protected information is the term we use for highly sensitive information that is protected by law or regulation. It requires the highest level of access control and security protection while in storage or in transit. Unlike confidential information, with protected information there are defined legal consequences to not securing the information appropriately.</p>

		<h1>What is a Breach?</h3>
		<p>Due to the diverse nature of our work, many types of protected information are stored at the Firm, and must be handled with extreme care to ensure we do not inadvertently disclose the information.</p>
		<p>Some examples of potential inadvertent disclosures which could <em>potentially constitute a breach</em> include:</p>
		<ul>
		<li style=margin-bottom:10px><strong style=color:OrangeRed>Wayward email:</strong> An email message is mistakenly sent to an address belonging to someone outside the firm. The message contains several attachments including a spreadsheet with individual SSNs and client financial data. The unintended recipient is not authorized to view the data.
		<li style=margin-bottom:10px><strong style=color:OrangeRed>Lost Box:</strong> A box filled with records that contain the names, addresses and Social Security numbers of patients is accidentally discarded.
		<li style=margin-bottom:10px><strong style=color:OrangeRed>Dropped Drive:</strong> A USB thumb drive containing highly confidential client data is dropped on a train. The drive was not encrypted and cannot be found.

		</ul>

		<h1>Breach Notification</h3>
		<p>One of the key characteristics of protected information is that there is often a requirement to notify certain agencies or clients in the event of a data breach in which protected information is inadvertently disclosed.</p>
		<p>It's important to understand the timeframes associated with reporting the possible mishandling of protected information. In some cases, such as a HIPAA data breach, a breach of protected information must be reported without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 days.</p>
		<p>Per the firm's Incident Reporting Policy, all potential data breaches must be reported to the Director of Information Security, Chief Information Officer, or General Council immediately upon suspicion that an event has occurred.</p>
