		<h3>What is Phishing?</h3><br>
		<p>Phishing, pronounced “fishing,” is a type of social
		engineering cyber attack that relies on email or text messages. Phishing
		messages appear to be from a legitimate sender and include a request for you to
		take some sort of action, the end result of which is obtaining sensitive
		information for malicious purposes. Phishing continues to be one of the greatest
		threats to online privacy and security, and it targets your personal
		information as well as firm information. Phishing messages that target personal
		information often appear to come from reputable companies, such as financial
		institutions, credit card companies, or benefit providers.</p>

		<h3>Other Types of Phishing</h3><br>

		<strong>Spear Phishing</strong>

		<p>Spear phishing is a more targeted approach to phishing and
		is distinguished by three elements. First, the message appears to come from
		someone who is known and trusted by the recipient. Second, the message contains
		specific information that gives it credibility. And, third, the request in the
		spear phishing message appears to be reasonable, based on the alleged sender of
		the message.</p>

		<strong>Smishing</strong>

		<p>Smishing is text-based, or SMS (Short Message
		Service)-based, phishing scams. Smishing messages arrive in a mobile device’s
		message application in 140 characters or less and promise prizes or
		continuation of current services by requesting a number be called or a link in
		the message be clicked.</p>

		<H3>Best Practices - Avoid Becoming a Phishing Victim</h3><br>

		<p>Follow these practices to avoid
		being the victim of a phishing scam:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Even if a message appears to be from someone familiar, if it
		contains a request that seems unusual, it is best to use caution and call the
		person to verify the request is legitimate. If using email or SMS to verify the
		request, do not use the Reply feature. Instead, open a new message and enter
		the recipient’s email or text address directly.
		<li>Do not open an unexpected email attachment without first scanning
		it for viruses, even if the sender appears to be someone familiar.
		<li>Always trust your instincts. If a message contains an unusual
		request for assistance or doesn’t sound like something the sender would write,
		contains incorrect details, or includes an unusual request, confirm the content
		with the sender.
		<li>If an email message contains a link to a website, open a browser
		and type the website address directly or use a search engine to locate the
		website rather than click the link contained in the email message.
		</ul>
